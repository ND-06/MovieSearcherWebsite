# The Movie Searcher Website

This exercise has been made by myself and the support of my team (THP-Nice) in order to pratice scrapping in Ruby on Rails. 
This exercise has been made with Postgresql, open-uri, nokogiri, themoviedb gem, and has been published on Heroku.

Please, after cloning the repo, make a bundle install inside the folder, make a rails db:create, and then a rails db:migrate.

This website allows you to search, by typing the title of the movie, some informations : The release date of the movie, the name of the movie and the picture related to the movie.

This scrapping has been build with themoviedb gem, a famous website which gives informations about all movies.
